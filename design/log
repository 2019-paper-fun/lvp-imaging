Day 1
=====

Discussion:
-> General introduction, eye stuff, slit lamp
-> Denoising, illumination correction for raw images

Work:
-> Familiarised with the lab
-> Got hold of the camera being used, tested resolution and noise variance

Issues and Todos for tomorrow and later:
-> Understand what the method does and the reflective case						| ?? 																
-> LED Matrix, decide what to do for "low illumination by LEDs at edges"				| Done.
-> Test-bench: Mostly transparency, no reflection effects on our measurement				| Done.
-> 3D print something for the camera									| Done.
-> Play around with lens, camera. See how imaging works. Remember the scale markings on your pad	| Done.
-> Present your approach										| Done.

Notes:
-> Long-term goals, according to me:
	-- Computation acceleration, GPU Parallelization in Matlab (doesn't take much time)
	-- How much redundancy? Convergence speed and LED separation
	-- Deconvolute image using lens PSF, not a low-pass filter

Day 2
=====

Work:
-> Started coding the basic FPM system specified in the paper
-> Finalized the presentation

#**************************************************************************************************************

Day 3
=====

Work:
-> Finished coding the FPM system specified in the paper

#**************************************************************************************************************

Day 4
=====

Discussion:
-> Setting up the system for imaging
-> Optical fibers for light transport?
-> Selecting lenses for two-lens system (50mm and 50mm)
-> Familiarised with the optical table and other systems in the lab

#**************************************************************************************************************

Day 5
=====

Work:
-> 3D-printing slide holder and holders for the lens system
-> Aligning lenses and source with the laser

#**************************************************************************************************************

Day 6
=====

Work:
-> Re-designing the slide holder and 3D-printing it
-> Tried to image slide sample with the LED source in lab, ended up imaging diffraction patterns
-> Diffuse source needed to prevent saturation
-> Took pictures of the slide under a microscope

#**************************************************************************************************************

Day 7
=====

Work:
-> Found the LED array and made it work
-> Changed imaging lens to 150mm focal length, 3x magnification
-> Focussed the sample on the camera feed
-> Aligned the LED array source to center it and illuminate the entire FOV properly
-> 3D-printing a holder for the LED array

#**************************************************************************************************************

Day 8
=====

Work:
-> Finished setting up the system
-> Camera fixed, both lenses fixed, slide on X stage and LED array source on magnetic mount
-> Aligned the LED array source to center it and illuminate the entire FOV properly
-> Removed reflection artefacts from the FOV by attaching a paper pipe between the lenses
-> Improved focus with the LED array using the center LEDs
-> Imaged the sample illuminating different LEDs. Find images in images/20141129_Transparency
-> Working on the mathematics behind the method and processing the images
