Day 1
=====

Discussion:
-> General introduction, eye stuff, slit lamp
-> Denoising, illumination correction for raw images

Work:
-> Familiarised with the lab
-> Got hold of the camera being used, tested resolution and noise variance

Todos for tomorrow and later:
-> Understand what the method does and the reflective case						| 																
-> LED Matrix, decide what to do for "low illumination by LEDs at edges"				| 
-> Test-bench: Mostly transparency, no reflection effects on our measurement				|
-> 3D print something for the camera									|
-> Play around with lens, camera. See how imaging works. Remember the scale markings on your pad	|
-> Present your approach										|

Notes:
-> Long-term goals, according to me:
	-- Computation acceleration, GPU Parallelization in Matlab (doesn't take much time)
	-- How much redundancy? Convergence speed and LED separation
	-- Deconvolute image using lens PSF, not a low-pass filter

Day 2
=====

Work:
-> Coded the basic FPM system specified in the paper
